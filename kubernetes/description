KUBERNETES CLUSTER SETUP:
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (physical or virtual machines) that run containerized applications.
There are multiple ways to setup kubernetes cluster.
1.SELF MANAGER K8'S CLUSTER
a.mini kube (single node cluster)
b.kubeadm(multi node cluster)
c. KOPS
2. CLOUD MANAGED K8'S CLUSTER
a. AWS EKS
b.AZURE AKS
c.GCP GKS
d.IBM IKE

we are facing so many issues like 
  etcd crashed
  scheduler not working properly
  master node downtime
  certification expired
  api server down etc...

by using eks , we dont bother all these things. and eks is highly robust
  eks is used to create the eks cluster and kubectl is  allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters


why we use eks?
EKS offers far more flexibility when managing the underlying resources with the flexibility to run on EC2, Fargate, and even on-premise via EKS Anywhere
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy and run containerized applications on AWS
  
how do we expose the pod? using services
here we use node port service to access application
